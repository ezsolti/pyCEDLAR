# pyCEDLAR: Package to estimate Cumulative Effective dose and Lifetime attributable risk

``pyCEDLAR`` is a python package for estimating the cumulative effective dose (CED) and the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) after a fallout.

It is intended for nuclear regulatory bodies, for emergency preparedness and response. It is also intended for researchers and students in order to assess uncertainty propagation.

As a package, ``pyCEDLAR`` provides

- a set of constants (dose conversion factors etc)
- implementation of the formulae of C. R채채f et al.

The python package is rather intended for research, and a compiled version with a GUI intended for decision makers is available at [TODO](...).
